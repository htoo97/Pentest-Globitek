# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL injection

 * In the salesperson info pages with the format "?id=XX" in the url, when tested by adding a ' to the end of the url, the red and green page simply redirect, while the green page shows a sql error message saying "Database query failed.". This gave away that the blue site had SQL Injection vulnerability, as shown in the gif walkthrough with a simple sleep command.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

 * When using a nonexistent username and a random password, the site's error message states "Log in was unsuccessful.". However, when using an existing/valid username and a random password, it shows the error message, but in bold "__Log in was unsuccessful.__".
